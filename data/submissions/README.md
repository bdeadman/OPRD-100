### Reaction Data Format
Follow the OPRD-100 schema structure. See the [validation_reactions.json](../OPRD-100.json) file for complete examples.

## 🚀 How to Submit

1. **Fork this repository**
2. **Extract reactions** from OPRD-100 papers using your method
3. **Create your submission file** as `data/submissions/your_name.json`
4. **Create a pull request**
   - `git checkout -b your_submission_team_name`
   - `git add data/submissions/your_name.json`
   - `git commit -m "[SUBMISSION] your_submission_team_name"`
   - head over to GitHub to complete the pull request with the following: 
    - Title: `[SUBMISSION] Your Name/Team`
    - Description: Brief overview of your method
5. **Automated evaluation** will:
   - Run scoring against the ground-truth dataset
   - Generate plots in `results/your_name_timestamp/`
   - Update the leaderboard in README.md
   - Comment results on your PR

## ✅ Validation Tips

Before submitting:
- Ensure your JSON is valid (use a JSON validator)
- Match the OPRD-100 schema structure
- Extract from the same papers/locations as the ground-truth dataset
- Include all required fields

## 📊 Scoring Metrics

Your submission will be evaluated using:
- **Reaction SMILES similarity**: Exact string matching
- **Reagent similarity**: Name and amount matching
- **Solvent similarity**: Name and amount matching  
- **Time/Temperature similarity**: Value comparison
- **Yield similarity**: Product and percentage matching

See [example_scoring.ipynb](../notebooks/example_scoring.ipynb) for detailed metric descriptions.
